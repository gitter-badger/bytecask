#### Bytecask - low latency k/v storage component ####

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/crispywalrus/bytecask](https://badges.gitter.im/crispywalrus/bytecask.svg)](https://gitter.im/crispywalrus/bytecask?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

[ ![Codeship Status for crispywalrus/bytecask](https://codeship.com/projects/b7a10f10-4b26-0132-7bb6-76839271be27/status)](https://codeship.com/projects/46645)

* lightweight - no dependencies, no underlying storages
* embeddable building block, no daemons, no external scripts needed
* storage component for distributed NoSQL databases
* inspired by [Bitcask](https://github.com/basho/bitcask) (Erlang)
* optional fast compression (backed by [snappy-java](http://code.google.com/p/snappy-java/))
* support for expiration and eviction
* support for keys with common prefixes (i.e. urls, files etc)
* blob store/retrieve (i.e. for files)
* passivation/activation (if db is idle we may release resources and restore it when necessary)
* Apache 2.0 License

### Key properties: ###

* keys in memory
* low latency write (appending)
* low latency read (direct read)
* values can be blobs (large values)
* compaction/merging

### Install ###

**sbt**

````libraryDependencies += "net.crispywalrus.bytecask" %% "bytecask" % $VERSION````

### Example ###

```scala

val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo")
db.put("foo", "some value...")
println(db.get("foo"))
db.delete("foo")
db.destroy()

//other methods of initialization:

val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with Compression
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo", prefixedKeys=true) with Compression
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with Eviction { val maxCount = 3 }
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with Expiration { val ttl = 180 }
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with BlobStore { val blockSize = 1024 * 1024 }
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with Compression with Expiration with BlobStore {
    val ttl = 180
    val blockSize = 1024 * 1024
}
val db = new Bytecask("/home/foo") with JmxSupport

...

//blob store example

val db = new Bytecask(mkTempDir) with BlobStore {
      val blockSize = 1024 * 1024
}

// store a blob (i.e. file) passing an input stream to read data from

db.storeBlob(name, new FileInputStream(...))

// retrieve the blob passing an output stream to write the blob to

withResource(new FileOutputStream(...)) {
      os => db.retrieveBlob(name, os)
}

...

// passivation/activation example

if (db.idleTime > 15*60*1000)
    db.passivate()

// passivation releases memory occupied by the index (data is not gone though)
// now all access methods throw exception as the db is inactive (no references are kept)

if (!db.isActive)
    db.activate()

// activation restores index from files and sets 'active' state

```

### API ###
```scala

  def put(key: Array[Byte], value: Array[Byte])

  def get(key: Array[Byte]): Option[Array[Byte]]

  def delete(key: Array[Byte]): Option[Array[Byte]]

  def keys(): Set[Array[Byte]]

  def values(): Iterator[Array[Byte]]

  def merge(): Unit

  def close(): Unit

  def destroy(): Unit

  def passivate(): Unit

  def activate(): Unit

  def idleTime: Long

  def isActive: Boolean

  def isDirty: Boolean

```
### Glossary ###

* Index (Keydir) - keys are kept in memory and point to entries in data files
* Data files - files that contain the actual data
* Merge - depending on update/delete intensity more and more space is occupied, so
merge operation compacts data as well as merges files into one
* Hint files - when files are merged to one file a "hint file" is produced out of the new file being
a persisted index, so later the index can be rebuilt w/o processing the data file (however anyway
can be built)
* Prefixed keys - keys that contain common prefixes like file paths, URLs etc. In this case it is not efficient
to allocate memory for all those repetitive byte sequences. It is advisable to turn prefixed keys mode on, in order
to have a dedicated map implementation being used (based on [Patricia Trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree))
that keeps data in a tree manner so that common parts of keys are reused vs allocated separately
* Passivation - if we maintain multiple Bytecask instances (say per user) and some of them are not being used frequently
it may not be critical to keep all indexes in memory. Passivation puts an instance "on hold",to be activated later,
what means the index will have to be reread to memory later. This may improve overall resources management/scalabilty
at the price of occasional activation time.
* Blob store - internal architecture has inherent limitation as to the value size as it is internally represented as
an array of bytes. It means that blobs (files included) cannot be easily stored. The blob store function of the API
breaks blob's value down to segments so that multiple segments (plus a descriptor entry) altogether hold the value.
Storing and retrieving relies on streams rather than on byte arrays as the value by definition is large.
* Eviction/Expiration - eviction is a mechanism to manage which entries should be removed (at the moment based on max items),
expiration is removal based on time (TTL).
